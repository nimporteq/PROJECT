        <pre>A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game, RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles
        of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative,
        either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character
        development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and
        guidelines.

        There are several forms of role-playing games. The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing
        game (TRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing (LARP), players physically
        perform their characters' actions. In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually
        decides on the rules and setting to be used, while acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the
        role of a single character.

        Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multiplayer text-based Multi-User Dungeons
        (MUDs) and their graphics-based successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).
        Role-playing games also include single-player role-playing video games in which players control a character, or
        team of characters, who undertake(s) quests and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical
        mechanics. These electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs, but emphasize character
        advancement more than collaborative storytelling.

        This type of game is well-established, so some RPG-related game forms, such as trading/collectible card games
        (CCGs) and wargames, may not be included under the definition. Some amount of role-playing activity may be
        present in such games, but it is not the primary focus. The term role-playing game is also sometimes used to
        describe games involving roleplay simulation and exercises used in teaching, training, and academic research.

      <p>First-person shooter (FPS) is a<br> sub-genre of shooter video games<br> centered on gun and other weapon-based combat<br>
        in a first-person perspective<br>, with the player experiencing the action through<br> the eyes of the protagonist and
        controlling<br> the player character in a three-dimensional<br> space. The genre shares common traits with<br> other
        shooter games<br>, and in turn falls under the action game genre. Since the genre's inception, advanced 3D and
        pseudo-3D graphics have challenged hardware development, and multiplayer gaming has been integral.

        The first-person shooter genre has been traced back to Wolfenstein 3D (1992), which has been credited with
        creating the genre's basic archetype upon which subsequent titles were based. One such title, and the progenitor
        of the genre's wider mainstream acceptance and popularity, was Doom (1993), often considered the most
        influential game in this genre; for some years, the term Doom clone was used to designate this genre due to
        Doom's influence Corridor shooter was another common name for the genre in its early years, since processing
        limitations of the era's hardware meant that most of the action in the games had to take place in enclosed
        areas, such as in cramped spaces like corridors and tunnels

        1998's Half-Life—along with its 2004 sequel Half-Life 2—enhanced the narrative and puzzle elements. In
        1999, the Half-Life mod Counter-Strike was released and, together with Doom, is perhaps one of the most
        influential first-person shooters. GoldenEye 007, released in 1997, was a landmark first-person shooter for home
        consoles, while the Halo series heightened the console's commercial and critical appeal as a platform for
        first-person shooter titles. In the 21st century, the first-person shooter is the most commercially viable video
        game genre, and in 2016, shooters accounted for over 27% of all video game sales.</p>

        <pre>Metroidvania is a sub-genre of action-adventure video games and platformers focused on guided non-linearity
        and utility-gated exploration and progression. The term is a portmanteau of the names of the video game series
        Metroid and Castlevania, based on the template from Metroid from 1986, Castlevania II from 1987, and
        Castlevania: Symphony of the Night from 1997. Since Symphony of the Night creator Koji Igarashi took more
        inspiration from The Legend of Zelda series, this gameplay formula of action-exploration is less commonly known
        as a Zeldavania or Zeldatroid.

        
        The first Metroid game in 1986 established principles of the non-linear platformer that were refined through
        multiple iterations, with Super Metroid in 1994 considered to have polished the style of gameplay core to
        Metroidvanias. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night in 1997 is considered the defining Metroidvania game,
        incorporating role-playing game elements from The Legend of Zelda series with non-linear traversal within the
        Castlevania series; most subsequent Castlevania games followed its approach and refined the genre. Symphony of
        the Night's assistant director, Koji Igarashi, is credited with establishing key principles of Metroidvanias
        through his work on other Castlevania games. In the 2010s, a resurgence in Metroidvanias came about due to
        several critically praised, independently developed games.</pre>
