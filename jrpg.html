        <h2>XENOBLADE CHRONICLES 2</h2>
        </li>>
    </center>
</ul>

<center>
    <pre>a popular roleplaying game of the xeno series,having come out in 2017, it is a game that had a lot of expecations
    and excitement going towards it's release as it is the sequel of the critically aclaimed xenoblade chronicles,
    there is a lot to go over this enormous game and all of it's content which is why we have decided to take it
    nice and slow with it</pre>
</center>



<li>
    <center>
        <h2>the story</h2>
    </center>
</li>
<center>
    <pre>the story of xenoblade chronicles 2 is an incredible one,Rex, an orphaned salvager who collects treasure from
    below the Cloud Sea for money, is hired by Argentum Trade Guild Chairman Bana to aid the Drivers Jin, Malos, and
    Nia, part of a group named Torna, in the salvage of an ancient ship. In the ship, they find Pyra, a legendary
    Blade known as the Aegis. When Rex reaches out to touch Pyra's sword, Jin fatally stabs him. Rex awakens on a
    field with Pyra, who reveals they are in a memory of her old home Elysium. She asks him to bring her to Elysium
    and in exchange gives him half of her Core Crystal to revive him. With help from his Titan companion Azurda and
    Nia, who has defected from Torna, Rex escapes to the Titan Gormott, but Azurda is wounded and reverts to his
    larval stage. Soon after, they arrive in Gormott's capital Torigoth and are joined by the Nopon Driver Tora and
    his artificial Blade Poppi. The group try to get to Elysium, but are stopped by the artifice Ophion and
    swallowed by the Titan Uraya.

    After the group battles the mercenary Driver Vandham while escaping Uraya's stomach, he joins the party and Rex
    begins to look to him as a mentor. The group later learns that Jin and Malos are the leaders of Torna, a
    terrorist group named after a Titan destroyed in the Aegis War 494 years ago. Led by Jin, an embittered veteran
    Blade of the Aegis War, and Malos, later revealed as the other Aegis, they seek to destroy humanity by
    unleashing the artifice Aion on Elysium. During a battle with Malos and fellow Torna member Akhos, Vandham is
    killed and Pyra unveils her true form Mythra. They have shared memory and consider themselves sisters, switching
    back and forth as needed.

    The group's search for a way past Ophion leads them to join forces with Mòrag, special inquisitor of Mor Ardain
    and elder sister of the Ardainian Emperor, Niall; and Zeke, prince of Tantal. In Tantal, the group battles Jin,
    who forces Pyra to surrender. While Azurda leads the group to the third Aegis sword to save Pyra, Malos siphons
    Pyra's power to regain his full strength. After the group finds the third sword, phantoms of Pyra's former
    Driver nearly kill Rex, but he is deemed worthy of the third sword. The group confronts Jin and Malos at the
    Cliffs of Morytha, during which Rex unlocks Pyra and Mythra's true form Pneuma. Rex, now matched with Jin's
    power, forces Malos to summon Ophion, who knocks the group into Morytha, the devastated land beneath Cloud Sea.

    In Morytha, the group is forced to work with a weakened Jin. Malos' Driver, Amalthus attacks by controlling
    various Titans. The group severs his connection to the Titans, only for him to kill all Torna members except
    Malos and Jin, with Jin defeating Amalthus as he dies. The group arrives in Elysium and meet the Architect, a
    scientist named Klaus who explains that he had discovered a device that sends objects into different dimensions,
    the use of which split his body in two and destroyed the old world

    Sensing that his other half is about to die,[c] which will result in his own death, Klaus sends the group to
    stop Malos, who was corrupted by Amalthus's malice and has obtained Aion. After Malos's defeat and death, Klaus
    dies, but not before granting Rex and the party a "final gift". Klaus's death causes Elysium to begin crumbling.
    Pneuma helps the group escape, but sacrifices herself to detonate the World Tree, preventing its debris from
    destroying Alrest. The group barely survives when Azurda, thanks to Pneuma, returns to his adult form and flies
    everyone down to Alrest. On returning to Alrest, the Cloud Sea fades to reveal a rejuvenated world, the Titans
    merging to form a new landmass. Afterwards, Pyra and Mythra are revived in separate bodies and reunite with Rex.

<center>
<pre>Regardless of whether you loved or…didn’t love Xenoblade Chronicles 2, there’s one thing I think we all can agree
    on: the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. I greatly enjoyed the game itself, and even I have no problem
    whatsoever saying the music is the best part of the experience. Because it really is, and that’s quite a feat
    after the excellent soundtrack we got with the original Xenoblade.</pre>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<pre>Of course, part of the reason for this excellence is that the team responsible for the original’s stellar
    soundtrack is back, minus Yoko Shimomura. In her absence, the venerable Yasunori Mitsuda steps up to take over
    Shimomura’s role as the main theme/crucial cutscene composer. And as much as I enjoyed Shimomura’s work on the
    original Xenoblade, this is a very good thing. You might have heard reports that Mitsuda cried during the
    recording of this soundtrack, and well, those tears are earned: Xenoblade Chronicles 2 represents some of his
    best work to date, in my humble opinion. And the rest of the Xenoblade crew are no slouches either. This is a
    soundtrack where every member gives their absolute all.</pre>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<pre>This soundtrack is also massive. The standard edition is five discs and weighs in at well over five hours of
    music. Then there are two special editions that add a sixth disc and 25 more minutes of music. There’s a lot to
    talk about on each disc, so I’m going to try to give the highlights as we proceed through this large collection.
  </pre>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<pre>The album opens with two tracks from Yasunori Mitsuda, the second of which introduces the game’s main theme with
    a lovely English horn solo and a swelling refrain featuring strings and choir. To this day, I’m still on the
    fence about whether I prefer this main theme or Shimomura’s classic title music from the original Xenoblade —
    the first time I heard Mitsuda’s theme, I thought it was a close second, but now I find myself feeling the
    opposite. No matter where you end up falling between the two, it’s undeniable that Mitsuda’s main theme is
    beautiful and powerful.
   </pre>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<pre>From there, “Argentum” provides an energetic start to the game’s exploration music — the erhu (or Chinese
    violin) is a particularly nice touch. Manami Kiyota’s first piece, “The Ancient Vessel,” has a peaceful, almost
    mystical vibe to it not unlike “Satorl Marsh (Night)” from the original Xenoblade; it’s a little unexpected so
    early into the album (and the game), but the serenity of the piece is not unwelcome. “Gormott” is likely what a
    lot of people will gravitate to on this disc, but I personally find the subpar quality of the string synths
    incredibly distracting, especially because they span most of the 5-minute track’s melody. Thankfully, “Battle!!”
    shows up afterward and absolutely blows the roof off with a rocking melody courtesy of Kenji Hiramatsu. Finally,
    “Torigoth” is a Celtic-inspired town theme composed by ACE, but you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s the work of
    Mitsuda; it sounds very much like a spiritual successor to Xenogears’ first town theme, “My Village is Number
    One!”
   </pre>
<br>
<br>
<pre>The second disc is the shortest on the standard soundtrack, but it still comes packed with memorable music.
    “Monster Surprised You” is an awkwardly blunt name for a battle track, but it’s one of the best boss themes on
    the entire album and definitely outshines “Death Match with Torna,” the other battle theme on this disc.
    “Kingdom of Uraya” and its nighttime variant are a dreamy pair of pieces whose sweet, lilting melodies create a
    magical mood. I was not disappointed when I saw the area this music accompanies in game. Let’s just say it
    definitely fits the space. “Fonsa Myma/Night” is another favorite; the daytime theme is grand and regal, as
    befits a proud capital, but I love the quiet acoustic guitar and rhythm of the night theme. Finally, “Drifting
    Soul” is a mid-game vocal theme that somewhat awkwardly plays during a rather dramatic series of events. I don’t
    particularly care for it, and there is another vocal theme at the end of the soundtrack that I vastly prefer,
    but I think having an interstitial song like this is an interesting musical choice nonetheless.</pre>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<pre>Disc three starts off with an absolutely deafening bang. “Counterattack” is Xenoblade Chronicles 2’s version of
    “Engage the Enemy,” and it’s one of the clear standouts on the entire album. The fast-moving refrain on this
    piece is supercharged with awesome, and while I probably still ultimately prefer its predecessor from the
    original Xenoblade, this is most certainly a worthy successor. Similarly, “You Will Recall Our Names” is both in
    title and style a followup to the original Xenoblade’s “You Will Know Our Names,” and it definitely earns its
    pedigree. It’s a rock battle track through and through, and it got my blood pumping every single time I heard it
    in game — which is a lot, because in addition to appearing in several key boss battles in the main story, it’s
    also used for all unique monster fights after reaching the fourth titan (where it replaces disc two’s “Those Who
    Stand Against Our Path,” a starkly inferior battle theme, in my opinion).</pre>

<br>
<br>
<pre>One other track on disc three I simply must talk about in detail is “Mor Ardain – Roaming the Wastes -.” This,
    to me, is the “Gaur Plain” of Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I know “Gormott” seems like the more obvious choice for
    this honor, as both the titan itself and its music were clearly designed to remind players of that first
    awe-inspiring area in the original Xenoblade. But for me, the explosive beat and brass-heavy band featured in
    “Mor Ardain” had my rapt and undivided attention from the first brief snippets I heard of it in pre-release
    demos, which is the exact same reaction I had when I first heard “Gaur Plain.” The styles are different, but at
    least to me, the spiritual connection is there.</pre>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tx3AbguQZHU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<br>
<pre>Another interesting thing to note about “Mor Ardain” is that it features a stinger at the end to wrap the music
    up without needing a fade out. In fact, this technique is employed randomly in several area and battle tracks
    across the album. This is somewhat unexpected for a JRPG soundtrack, but it’s a nice addition that makes the
    music feel like a performance rather than a loop.</pre>


<br>
<br>
<pre>The fourth disc in this mammoth soundtrack is another strong one, though it is slightly marred by containing
    some of my least favorite tracks on the album, namely “Temperantia” and “Cliffs of Morytha.” The former is just
    loud and boring (also an apt description for the location in which it plays), and the latter is worse because it
    uses similar instrumentation to my absolute favorite track from the original Xenoblade Chronicles, “Mechonis
    Field,” but in a really dull and plodding way that isn’t remotely in the same ballpark as its predecessor.</pre>


<br>
<br>
<pre>Don’t let my complaints fool you; the vast majority of this disc is fantastic. In particular, disc four houses
    all four tracks performed by the Irish a cappella group ANÚNA, and you should listen to all of them. These
    pieces really bring me back to some of Mitsuda’s classic work on Xenogears and Xenosaga, and each one is
    composed, arranged, and performed brilliantly. A few other tracks that are definitely worth a listen on this
    disc include “The Decision” and “Still, Move Forward!” The former is my personal favorite piece of cutscene
    music on the entire album; it’s a dramatic piece, with a pulsing beat, ominous strings, and accentuating choral
    work that just screams “something serious is about to go down.” And the latter is probably my favorite normal
    battle theme. It reminds me a lot of “Mechanical Rhythm” from the original Xenoblade Chronicles; the fast-paced
    energy and shifting keys have such momentous movement that it feels impossible not to get pumped up or jam out
    when listening to this music.</pre>


<br>
<br>
<pre>Disc five rounds out the standard edition of the soundtrack with roughly what you’d expect for the end of a
    JRPG: subdued yet emotional final dungeon music (“Yggdrasil”), climatic boss themes heavy on both orchestra and
    chorus, a weighty number of cutscene pieces, and a final vocal theme. In some ways, this is my least favorite
    disc on the standard soundtrack because there isn’t as much that stands out to me, unlike the previous four
    discs. The final boss theme (“After Despair and Hope”) is a good example of this: it has one great part a little
    over a minute in and then again at the end, but it feels like a lead-in for something truly epic that just never
    materializes. I greatly enjoyed Kenji Hiramatsu’s other battle themes on the album, but this is one place where
    I wish Mitsuda had taken over: his final boss themes do tend to be absolutely incredible, after all. There are
    also some tracks that are very ambient, featuring next to no melody, and while I appreciate their inclusion for
    the sake of having a complete soundtrack, they are undeniably dull. You’ll listen to them once and then probably
    never again.</pre>

<br>
<br>
<pre>still, the final series of cutscene themes are quite strong, particularly “Parting” and “The Tomorrow with You.”
    These pieces are replete with references to the game’s main theme, as befits music that plays during the story’s
    denouement. Similarly, the ending vocal theme (“One Last You”) is an excellent capstone piece for the standard
    edition of the soundtrack. Jen Bird’s singing is lovely, and I find the melody and lyrics to be both beautiful
    and bittersweet, particularly the portion around 4:20 that references the main theme — I do love thematic
    composition, after all. On the whole, I find it to be a much better ending theme than “Beyond the Sky” from the
    original Xenoblade, which I basically couldn’t stand. “One Last You” is also bolstered by being one of many
    tracks composed by Mitsuda, instead of his sole contribution, so it benefits from being part of his vision for
    the soundtrack as a whole.</pre>


<br>
<br>
<pre>If you have the standard edition of the soundtrack, that is where the music ends. But if you have one of the
    special editions, there is a sixth disc with some extra goodies. The first 16 tracks are all of the various
    jingles that play when you do things like find a new location, obtain a quest, or get a new blade. They’re
    nothing particularly special, but it’s a nice addition for the sake of completeness.</pre>


<br>
<br>
<pre>The real gems on this disc are five piano arrangements of key tracks from the album proper. They are all
    fantastic, and each makes an excellent case for a Xenoblade piano album. The standout for me is “Counterattack.”
    Not only is the arrangement itself excellent (no small feat considering how epic and energetic the source
    material is) but it’s also bookended by a catchy bit of original composition. The arrangements in general tend
    to be played straight; they have embellishments and interpretations of course, like any good arrangement should,
    but they ultimately stick to the musical script. Which means that original interludes, like those in
    “Counterattack,” give the music a little something extra and make the arrangement feel more unique.</pre>


<br>
<br>
<pre>I could talk about this album a lot more, but if you’ve stuck with me, you’re probably ready for a bottom line.
    It is simply this: the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 soundtrack is fantastic and absolutely belongs in your collection.
    The music is equal parts gorgeous, fun, and pulse-pounding, and while there are a few duds here and there, they
    in no way diminish the stellar achievements made by each and every artist involved with this album. If you
    thought the original Xenoblade Chronicles set a high bar with its soundtrack, consider the bar raised to
    stratospheric levels</pre>

<center><h2>STORY</h2>
<pre>Reisalin "Ryza" Stout is a girl living on Kurken Island who is eager to have her own adventures. One day she sneaks
to the mainland by boat with her friends Lent Marslink and Tao Mongarten, where they meet and befriend Klaudia
Valentz, a merchant's daughter. The four are ambushed by a monster and rescued by the alchemist Empel Vollmer and
his bodyguard Lila Decyrus. Impressed with Empel and Lila's skills, Ryza, Tao and Lent convince the duo to accept
them as apprentices. Empel starts teaching Ryza the basics of alchemy and helping with Tao's studies while Lent
begins combat training with Lila. As the trio improves, they restore an abandoned cottage in the forest which
becomes Ryza's atelier and their base of operations on the mainland. Klaudia later joins the party in their
adventures after earning her father's approval</pre></center>
<center><h2>GAMEPLAY</h2></center>
<center>
<pre>Atelier Ryza is a Japanese role-playing video game with a significant crafting component, called alchemy. In the
    combat portions of the game, battles utilize a modified turn-based combat system incorporating real-time
    elements. Time moves continuously while the player gives commands to the characters in the party. Attacks build
    Action Points which can be used to perform skills or special attacks, or to raise the party's Tactics Level
    which gives access to more powerful abilities.

    Outside of combat, the game revolves around alchemy. This involves gathering resources while out in the field,
    and placing them onto a field of elemental nodes to discover new recipes and create a wide variety of usable
    items. New to the series in Atelier Ryza is the ability to automate gathering and item synthesis for players
    that are more interested in the other aspects of the game.</pre>
