        <p>a classic brought back to life
            Doom Eternal is a first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks.
            The sequel to Doom (2016), and the sixth main game in the Doom series, it was released on March 20, 2020,
            for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One, with a version for Nintendo Switch being released on
            December 8, 2020, and versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S being released on June 29,
            2021. Set some time after the events of the 2016 game, the story follows the Doomslayer once again, on a
            mission to end Hell's consumption of Earth and foil the alien Maykrs' plans to exterminate humanity.

            Along with the single-player campaign, a multiplayer mode, Battlemode, was introduced. In this mode, players
            can either play as the Doom Slayer or as a demon, and fight until either the Doom Slayer defeats the demons,
            or vice versa. Another mode, Horde mode, was added in October 2021. The Ancient Gods, a two-part standalone
            campaign DLC set after the events of the main game, was released between October 2020 and March 2021.

            Doom Eternal was released to a positive critical response, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level
            design, soundtrack, and combat mechanics, though some disliked the increased focus on storytelling and its
            platforming sections. Doom Eternal received five nominations at The Game Awards for 2020, including Game of
            the Year and Best Action Game. so it is safe to say that it is a very good and high octane game and why it
            is considered to be one of the greatest first person shooter games ever made

            <h1>STORY</h1>
        </center>
        <p>i hope you are ready because this game's story is quite a doozy

            Even if you played Doom 2016, you might find yourself a bit lost with Doom Eternal and its much more
            involved, expansive story. The game starts with a full-scale demonic invasion of Earth, doesn't make clear
            what's happened since the last game, and for some reason, gives you your own spaceship that's also a castle.
            And now there's a story expansion that's rapidly approaching, adding even more confusion and weirdness to
            the already expansive and convoluted tale. Even if you think you're pretty well-versed in Doom lore, you
            might find yourself lost at the start of id Software's latest--it expects you to know everything from the
            last Doom game, have a good understanding of lore from two decades of Doom titles, and read a whole bunch of
            collectible codex entries to fill in the gaps.

            Before we get to the story of the Doom Slayer and his homicidal crusade to kill all demons, we have to set
            up all the other characters who are a big part of Doom Eternal, but whom you've probably never heard of
            before. The big villain of Doom Eternal is the Khan Makyr, who represents a race of people from a planet
            called Urdak--they're essentially angels and the planet is basically techno-heaven. Urdak is so special that
            it actually exists outside of physical reality, making it almost impossible to get there if the Makyrs don't
            want you to.</p>
        <center>
            <h3>the makyrs</h3>
        </center>
        <img src="RES\3646945-doom eternal_20200312205009.jpg" alt="makyrs">
        <p>
            Long ago, the Makyrs were created, or otherwise encountered and were elevated by, an entity known as the
            Father. It's not super clear who or what the Father was, but its essence stayed in Urdak for a long time,
            becoming the center of Makyr society. During this time, the Makyrs would undergo a process called the
            Transfiguration: though they were very long-lived, eventually, Makyrs would start to degrade, and the
            Transfiguration seems to be some sort of death and rebirth cycle. It sounds like the Makyrs are actually
            individual people who create a big collective consciousness when they die, so the Transfiguration seems like
            it's some kind of reincarnation through that process.

            Every 10,000 years, the Makyrs choose and create a leader from their collective consciousness: the Khan.
            That person then leads the Makyrs until the next Khan is chosen, and in that time, the Makyrs are physically
            incapable of disobeying the Khan. So while there's a built-in term limit for the Khan Makyr through the
            Transfiguration, the Khan has a lot of power--and they might not want to give that up. That'll be relevant
            in a minute.

            So eventually, something weird happens and the Father just vanishes. Makyr lore suggests the Father's
            essence might have been stolen by a Makyr called the Seraphim, but the details are sketchy. The point is,
            the Father is gone, and that messes up Makyr society, and more specifically, the Transfiguration, which now
            sounds awful for the Makyrs (though we're not exactly sure how). Basically, the Makyrs are scared of the
            messed-up Transfiguration and the Khan is looking for ways to stop it.</p>
        <h3>the sentinels</h3>
        <img src="RES\3532479-doom_eternal_sentinel_prime.jpg" alt="sentinels">
        <p> Meanwhile, on a planet called Argent D'Nur, a group of kick-ass space warriors rise and create a society.
            These people call themselves the Argenta, and they take over their harsh, spooky, and apparently
            monster-filled world through conquest. They create an army of holy knights called the Night Sentinels, whose
            job is to protect Argent D'Nur and do justice and whatnot.

            The Argenta are such good warriors that they somehow get the attention of the Makyrs, who visit Argent D'Nur
            and pretty much start getting worshiped as gods. Teaming with the Khan Makyr, the Sentinels start to become
            a force for conquest to other planets using Makyr technology, which bolsters the magics and tech the
            Sentinels had already created using their old gods from Argent D'Nur, some strange creatures called Wraiths.
            The Sentinels start heading to other planets, converting them to also worship the Makyrs, and things are
            generally good and prosperous for everyone.

            It's not really clear if the Makyrs are organic or some kind of big artificially intelligent computer
            system, but their collective consciousness was able to analyze probabilities to plot out possible futures.
            In all their future visions, the Makyrs kept seeing the same thing: a Sentinel warrior who would eventually
            destroy them, who they called the Unholy One. They created something called the Divinity Machine and asked
            the Sentinels to use it on their warriors to check them for "impurities" that might reveal the Unholy One
            before he could wreak havoc on Urdak. The Sentinels agreed--it's not super clear what the Divinity Machine
            is or does, but it was apparently sitting on Argent D'Nur, conveniently available for use in the story
            later.

            Meanwhile again, Doom 1 happens. On Mars, a security guard working in a Mars research facility finds himself
            in the midst of a demon invasion after scientists researching teleportation technology accidentally open
            portals to Hell. This Doom Guy goes on a John Wick-style rage mission after his pet rabbit, Daisy, is killed
            by the demons. He ravages his way through the Mars facilities, driven by little more than the force of his
            will. Then the demons try to invade Earth in Doom 2, and he fights them there, repelling that invasion.
            Demons attack another facility on one of the moons of Jupiter in Final Doom; Doom Guy shows up, he kills
            them all, and he gets even angrier. Eventually, Doom Guy gets so pissed off that he decides to go to Hell
            itself and kill even more demons in Doom 64.</p>
        <img src="RES\3646949-doom eternal night sentinels.jpg" alt="doom sentinel">
        <p> Doom Guy has a pretty successful campaign in Hell, but after wrecking the Mother of Demons, he decides to
            hang out in Hell for a while, killing all the hellions he can. But in a new Doom 64 level that's available
            in Doom Eternal, the Doom Guy gets portaled out of Hell by another boss-level demon.

            Through the course of Doom Eternal, we get the backstory on the protagonist, the Doom Slayer, that syncs up
            everything we've covered up to now in one big story. It seems when the big demon kicked the Doom Guy out of
            Hell, it sent him, perhaps randomly, to Argent D'Nur. There, the Doom Guy was found by the Sentinels and
            their
            priests, the Order of the Deag. All the stuff Doom Guy has gone through at this point has driven him pretty
            much
            insane, and all he knows is murder, saying stuff like "Rip and tear" and "Guts, huge guts." He comes to be
            known
            as the Outlander, and the Sentinels chuck him in their gladiator arena, where Argenta who break the law have
            a
            chance to redeem themselves through combat in order to join the army and get a glorious death.

            This is the big twist of Doom Eternal: the game reveals that the protagonist from the original Doom games
            is, in
            fact, the same person you've been controlling in Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal. He's definitely seen some sh*t
            at
            this point, but you've been playing the same Doom Guy this whole time. Eternal fills in the gaps on how it
            was
            possible for this regular space marine to turn into the legendary, feared Doom Slayer.

            In Doom Eternal, the twist is revealed in a cutscene that finds the Doom Guy showing up on Argent D'Nur,
            ranting
            about Hell and demons as he's brought before the two Order of Deag priests you eventually have to hunt down.
            As
            it turns out, the Sentinels and the Makyrs had never heard about the Hell dimension before Doom Guy showed
            up.
            It seems this might have given the Khan Makyr an idea, or at least piqued her curiosity, to look into Hell's
            fearsome power.

            The Doom Guy excelled in the arena thanks to his murder skills, winning the chance to join the Sentinel
            army.
            Not long after, though, demonic portals started to open on Argent D'Nur, with Hell beginning an invasion of
            the
            planet. The Sentinels and the Makyrs teamed up to fight them, but found the armies of Hell were unlike any
            opponent they'd faced before. The demons used some kind of powerful energy source that eclipsed everything
            the
            Sentinels and Makyrs had, and they found themselves losing the war.</p>

        <center>
            <h2>The Unholy Wars</h2>
        </center>
        <p> The Makyrs and Argenta fought the demons for years, and the Doom Guy excelled on the battlefield fighting
            alongside them. The tide only started to turn late in the war, though, after some of the Sentinels' priests
            captured some demons and started studying their capabilities. That's when they discovered the Essence, the
            power
            source the demons were using. The stuff was intensely powerful, capable of creating weapons, powering
            cities,
            healing the sick, and even resurrecting the dead.

            As the wars raged on, the Makyrs and the Sentinel priests discovered a way to open portals to Hell and
            started
            siphoning Hell's power for their own ends. They called the stuff Argent Energy, and it allowed the Night
            Sentinels to beat back the demonic hordes. They used Argent energy for their cities, and it made Argent
            D'Nur
            more prosperous than ever. The energy was also sent to Urdak, where it allowed the Makyrs to stave off the
            Transfiguration, living indefinitely. The Khan Makyr became, essentially, all-powerful, because without the
            Transfiguration, she would never be replaced and could never be defied.

            This whole time, the Night Sentinels were a little wary of Argent Energy--it seemed a little too good to be
            true. They still trusted the Makyrs, but they kept the Argent at arm's length while they kept fighting the
            demons. </p>

            <h2>Birth Of The Doom Slayer</h2>
        </center>
        <img src="RES\LOL.jpg" alt="doom">
        <center>
            <p>Things got bad again when the demons launched a big offensive against the Argenta city Taras Nabad (a
                place you
                revisit in Doom Eternal). Hell laid waste to the city and killed just about everyone inside, except the
                Doom Guy
                and a group of Sentinels who tried to hold out. Leading the charge was a giant demonic Titan, who was
                pretty
                much set to wipe out everything.

                Before the end can come, a Makyr called Samur intervenes. He takes Doom Guy to the Divinity Machine,
                where he
                zaps him with...something. Argent Energy maybe, it's tough to remember or to follow. Anyway, for some
                reason,
                the machine turns the Doom Guy into a superhuman killing machine, and he ceases to be the Doom
                Guy--instead, he
                becomes the Doom Slayer we know as the protagonist of Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal. The Doom Slayer rips
                through
                the demons and slays the Titan, and for his efforts, gets the unprecedented honor of joining the
                Sentinel army
                as an equal to the Argenta.

                With the Doom Slayer's help, the Sentinels start winning the war against Hell and things are going
                pretty well.
                They start pushing into Hell and fighting the demons on their own turf. And that's when they make a
                spooky
                discovery: the Makyrs are, in fact, the bad guys. Shocking.</p>

        <center>
            <p>Now we're finally catching up to the latest two games. In Doom 2016, Earth's United Aerospace
                Corporation,
                led by founder Dr. Samuel Hayden, finds a way to open portals into Hell. They discover all kinds of cool
                stuff, including the sarcophagus, a bunch of information about the Sentinels, and Argent Energy. Hayden
                wants to use Argent to solve Earth's energy crisis and he's okay with a little devil worship on the side
                if
                it gets the job done. But some of the UAC personnel take it all a little too seriously: specifically
                Olivia
                Pierce, one of the company's researchers.

                At some point, Pierce makes a deal with the demons for some serious power in return for helping them
                invade
                the UAC facility on Mars where the portals were discovered. It all goes poorly, as Pierce should
                probably
                have guessed. The invasion kills just about everyone in the UAC facility, but Hayden manages to wake up
                the
                Doom Slayer, who goes back to work.

                Now, you might be thinking that it's weird that Doom Guy started out on Earth fighting a demon invasion
                and
                then wound up back on Earth fighting another one. That seems to be a function of the Doom universe's
                various
                dimensions. Essentially, it seems that Doom is a multiverse, where Hell is a specific dimension, Urdak
                is
                another, and it's possible to potentially pass into other universes. Doom Guy started in a universe
                where
                Mars was invaded by demons, but by passing into Hell and back out again, he wound up in a new universe,
                where no demonic invasion of Mars had yet taken place.

                Anyway, the Doom Slayer works with Hayden to stop the demons and Pierce, but he also destroys the UAC's
                capacity for harvesting Argent Energy along the way, much to Hayden's dismay. The Doom Slayer also nabs
                Hayden's powerful AI, Vega, as he's ripping and tearing, and finds a powerful object called the
                Crucible,
                which he eventually uses to stop Hell's invasion of Mars. At the end of that game, Hayden manages to
                take
                the Crucible from the Doom Slayer, revealing that it's actually a ludicrously powerful Sentinel sword,
                as
                well as an energy source. He then uses portals to send the Doom Slayer to somewhere unknown.</p>

        <p>the gameplay,what brings every player towardsa game in the first place

            DOOM Eternal is an fast-paced, gory and excellent game. The weapons feel great, the new systems and gadgets
            make the combat flow even better than the previous game. The levels are bigger and easier to navigate, and
            when the combat flow hits you nothing is better. Shooting, freezing and blowing up hoards of demons have
            never been better

            next are your weapons

            each weapon feels like an actual addition instead of a replacement,adding into the creative ways you can
            kill demons in this game,from blowing them up,to shredding them,or burning them alive after freezing,this
            game provides an amazing aid to satisfy our gory needs and make the player feel like the boss of the
            game,instead of a victim,when you are in the room,the demons are trapped here with YOU

            Doom Eternal’s combat encounters are, quite possibly, the best in the genre. Snappy movement, a varied
            arsenal and executions, alongside a soundtrack that mixes atmospheric synths with pounding drums and
            devastating downtuned guitars all feed into the game’s trademark frenetic action. There’s unrivaled euphoria
            in crushing a demon’s head underfoot before moving on to kill hundreds more of his friends in equally brutal
            ways. Really, the only thing holding Doom Eternal back from reaching its full potential is its platforming
            which – although improved – take up too much time that could have been spent doing what Doom Eternal does
            best: letting you shoot the literal Hell out of scores of demons.

        <p>Anyone who has played the 2016 DOOM reboot or its successor DOOM Eternal will likely agree that the games
            just feel so incredibly, deliciously satisfying. There are many reasons for this, but today we're talking
            about that soundtrack, and oh boy, is it great. But why is the soundtrack so dang good?

            Obviously we can appreciate that the music itself is just really really cool, regardless of how or when it
            plays. But there’s more to it than that. When you take a closer look (and listen), you’ll realize there are
            some pretty unique features to the sounds you’re hearing
            Lots of thought went into bulking up the entire gaming experience of DOOM, with the aim of making it as big
            and intense as possible. A hallmark feature of the game - one which contributes greatly to its sheer level
            of deliciousness - is that smooth, incredibly fast-paced gameplay that continually pushes you forward as you
            hungrily chase after more action. And a lot of that flow is instilled by the game's soundtrack.

            Composer Mick Gordon wanted to find a way to tailor the game's music to the gameplay, to make it so it is
            dynamically in sync with the player’s movements. And that’s exactly what he and DOOM's devs managed to
            accomplish. Furthermore, they did it to a profound extent that hadn’t been accomplished until then
            Gordon's technique to accomplish this entailed creating musical pieces which include the usual chorus,
            verse, build-up, and transition structures but which "hand [those changes] over to the player's actions." He
            broke the music up into chunks with lots of different variants on those chunks, which then randomize as the
            player performs certain movements and actions.

            The result is a feeling that the music is actually responding to those actions, as opposed to merely looping
            passively in the background. And why is that particularly cool? Well, because there are few things as
            satisfying as when a sequence of events or movements are timed perfectly to the beats, riffs, rises, and
            falls in an accompanying track of music, right? That’s exactly what seems to happen in DOOM.
            This satisfaction is deepened even further thanks to the dose of nostalgia woven subtly into some of the
            tracks in 2016's DOOM. Gordon cleverly borrowed the foundations of tracks from the original 1993's DOOM -
            such as "The Imp Song" and "Hell's Keep" - and built on them, making them "bigger and bolder" and thus more
            fitting for the series' reboot. You can hear the echoes of these original tracks in Gordon's "Rust, Dust,
            And Guts" and "Vega Core" tracks, respectively.

            So, you knew that DOOM's soundtrack is tasty, but now you know a little more about why it's specifically
            tasty. The fact that the game's popping visuals and smooth movements are paired with deliciously epic,
            bass-heavy sounds that feel dynamically tailored to your gameplay, means that you’re left with that
            quintessential Doom-type satisfaction.</p>
