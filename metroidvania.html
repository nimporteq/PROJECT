            <pre>Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania video game developed and published by independent developer Team Cherry. In
        the game, the player controls the Knight, a nameless insectoid warrior, who explores Hallownest, a fallen
        kingdom plagued by a supernatural disease. The game is set in diverse subterranean locations, and it features
        friendly and hostile insectoid characters and numerous bosses. Players have the opportunity to unlock new
        abilities as they explore each location, along with pieces of lore and flavour text that are spread throughout
        the kingdom.</pre>

            <pre>The world of Hollow Knight is brought to life in vivid, moody detail, its caverns alive with bizarre and
            terrifying creatures, each animated by hand in a traditional 2D style.

            Every new area youâ€™ll discover is beautifully unique and strange, teeming with new creatures and characters
            to
            discover. The world of Hollow Knight is one worth exploring just to take in the sights and discover new
            wonders
            hidden off of the beaten path.</pre>

            <h2>THE STORY</h2>

            <img src="RES\download (1).gif" alt="THE STORY">
            <pre>At the outset of the game, the Knight arrives in Dirtmouth, a quiet town that sits just above the remains of the
        kingdom of Hallownest. As the Knight ventures through the ruins, they learn that Hallownest was once a
        flourishing
        kingdom which fell after becoming overrun with "The Infection", a supernatural disease that drove the kingdom's
        citizens to madness and undeath. Hallownest's ruler, The Pale King, had previously attempted to lock away the
        Infection in the Temple of the Black Egg. Despite the temple's magical seals, the disease managed to escape and
        Hallownest fell into ruin. The Knight's mission is to find and kill three bugs called the Dreamers, who act as
        the
        living seals on the temple door.<br> Once the seals have been removed, the Knight may confront the source of the
        Infection. This quest brings the Knight into conflict with Hornet, a warrior who tests their combat prowess in
        several battles, additionally to this the game proposes several free DLCs for players to enjoy</pre>

            <h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>
            <pre>Hollow Knight is a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania game that takes place in Hallownest, a fictional underground
        kingdom. The player controls an insect-like, silent, nameless knight while exploring the underground world. The
        Knight wields a type of sword called a Nail, which is used in both combat and environmental interaction.
<br>
        In most areas of the game, players encounter hostile bugs and other creatures. Melee combat involves using the
        Nail to strike enemies from a short distance. The player can also learn spells, allowing for long-range
        attacks. Defeated enemies drop currency called Geo. The Knight starts with a limited number of hit points,
        which are represented by masks. "Mask Shards" can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's
        maximum number of masks. By striking enemies, the Knight gains Soul, which is stored in the Soul Vessel. If all
        masks are lost, the Knight dies and a Shade enemy appears where they died. The player loses all Geo and can hold
        a reduced amount of Soul. Players need to defeat the Shade enemy to recover the lost currency and to carry the
        normal amount of Soul. The game continues from the last visited bench they sat on, which are scattered
        throughout the game world and act as save points. Initially the player can only use Soul to "Focus" and
        regenerate masks, but as the game progresses, players unlock several offensive spells which consume Soul.
        Additional Soul Vessels, used to hold more Soul, can be acquired throughout the game.
<br>
        Many areas feature more challenging enemies and bosses which the player may need to defeat in order to progress
        further.Defeating some bosses grants the player access to new abilities. Later in the game, players
        acquire the Dream Nail, a special sword that can access the minds of Hallownest's creatures. It also enables the
        player to face more challenging versions of a few bosses and to break the seal to the final boss. If the
        player defeats the final boss of the game, they are given access to a mode called "Steel Soul". In this mode,
        dying is permanent, and if the Knight loses all of their masks, the save slot will be reset.
<br>
        During the game, the player encounters bug-themed non-player characters (NPCs) with whom they can interact.
        These characters provide information about the game's plot and lore, offer aid, and sell items or services.
        The player can upgrade the Knight's Nail to deal more damage or find Soul Vessels to carry more Soul. During the
        course of the game, players acquire items that provide new movement abilities including an additional mid-air
        jump (Monarch Wings), adhering to walls and jumping off them (Mantis Claw), a quick dash (Mothwing Cloak), and a
        speedy super dash (Crystal Heart). The player can learn other combat abilities, known as Nail Arts, and the
        aforementioned spells. To further customise the Knight, players can equip various charms, which can be found or
        purchased from NPCs. Some of their effects include improved combat abilities or skills, granting more masks
        without regeneration, greater mobility, easier collecting of Geo or Soul, and other transformations to the
        Knight. Equipping a charm takes up a certain number of limited slots, called notches.
<br>
        Hallownest consists of several large, inter-connected areas with unique themes. With its nonlinear gameplay
        design, Hollow Knight does not bind the player to one path through the game nor require them to explore the
        whole world, though there are obstacles that limit the player's access to various areas. The player may need to
        progress in the story of the game, or acquire a specific movement ability, skill, or item to progress
        further. To fast travel through the game's world, the player can use Stag Stations, terminals connected to
        network of tunnels; players can only travel to previously visited and unlocked stations. Other fast travel
        methods, such as trams, lifts, and the "Dreamgate", are encountered later in the game.
<br>
        As the player enters a new area, they do not have access to the map of their surroundings. They must find
        Cornifer, the cartographer, in order to buy a rough map. As the player explores an area, the map becomes more
        accurate and complete, although it is updated only when sitting on a bench. The player will need to buy specific
        items to complete maps, to see points of interest, and to place markers. The Knight's position on the map can
        only be seen if the player is carrying a specific charm.</pre>

        <center><h2>THE SOUNDTRACK</h2></center>

        <center>
            <pre>if even the gameplay,story was not good enough then hopefully the music will be what sells you on this
            beautiful game

            There are many gorgeous and memorable tracks from Hollow Knight, courtesy of Christopher Larkin.

            The solemn main theme, "Hollow Knight", serves as one of the two major Leitmotifs that get played throughout
            the game's soundtrack. It's the first thing that you'll hear when you start the game, and expect to hear
            variations of this tune a lot somewhere like a Recurring Riff, notably in Boss Remixes such as the
            following:
            "Broken Vessel" encapsulates the titular Broken Vessel being similar to the Hollow Knight and the Knight via
            the similar musical riff, this time broken or distorted. Its own theme is more of a thriller, with plenty of
            loud accompanying instruments to symbolize the character losing to the infection. "Broken Vessel" also has
            faster beats than the original leitmotif, which alludes to the character being aggressive in its boss fight.
            "Sealed Vessel" is the theme for The Hollow Knight when you meet it inside the Black Egg Temple. It starts
            out imposing and grand after a prolonged silence, which is perfect for a corrupted final boss. The Dark
            Reprise of the main leitmotif is heard during the second half of the fight, when it begins Fighting from the
            Inside. The rapidly ascending and descending notes beginning at 1:00 are taken from "White Palace." When the
            boss is fighting the infection by stabbing itself, the music shifts to a lonely orchestral dirge to
            accompany this scene heard at the 2:15 mark (this sad version of the theme is also used during the Path of
            Pain and Birthplace sequences), followed by the choir getting louder (starting from the 3:28) to represent
            the climax of the fight, and finally becomes calm and slow again (around 4:38) when the battle ends, just
            before the screen fades to black and the ending cutscene plays.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyHn4980MPY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Pure Vessel", the theme for The Hollow Knight in their prime, is a choral arrangement of "Sealed Vessel".
            The chanting is clearer and more prominent this time, with less of the imposing vibe of the original,
            symbolizing the literal purity or glory of the Pure Vessel. It is as if this is one of the tracks that you
            can hear in a church ceremony.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/35pUQDrKy5A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Truth, Beauty and Hatred" is by far the most triumphant rendition, evoking the feeling of knights marching
            to war with drums, violins and trumpets. Ironically, this is the leitmotif of Grey Prince Zote, the game's
            Lethal Joke Character of a boss who has delusions of grandeur, thinking that he is a Knight in Shining Armor
            (which Bretta also believes). The major leitmotif is there, but this song also justifies the overall upbeat
            nature of itself since Zote thinks so high of himself that his boss theme lacks the persisting sad, gloomy
            and depressing melody of "The Hollow Knight" theme. The chorus, or the part where the track progresses at
            its loudest and fastest point, can be heard starting from the 1:21 timestamp of the video.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidGo704SvI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "False Knight" has a menacing drums-and-violin version of the "Hollow Knight" motif at the start and manages
            to maintain the loud and fast rhythm of the instruments all throughout the song, in order to correspond to
            how gigantic the False Knight is with that armor. Then everything fades into a slower tune that plays when
            you deal the killing blow to the boss.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDQNGDOdE4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            It is also heard in some stage ambience, like the "Fungal Wastes". The version of the Fungal Wastes is quite
            thematic for turning the leitmotif into something straight out of a cartoon... because the Mushroom Man
            citizens residing in the wastes serve as some of the comic-relief creatures of the game with their sound
            effects full of Narm Charm and a comedic factor in them. This Background Music just fits perfectly. The
            Mantis Village variation straightens up this theme into a more normally serious background theme. It manages
            to beautifully fit with the village and its environs, one of the first areas in which the game expects you
            to have learned how to play it, and also have some mildly catchy figures in the strings playing at the
            theme's foundation.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhUqu-g0pVY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            The unsettling drone in the Abyss actually contains the "Hollow Knight" theme, because it's the birthplace
            of the Vessels.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XxRUH8DOIQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

            "The White Lady" is the second major Leitmotif of the game. It is more relaxing and calmer than the first
            major leitmotif since it is played slowly on strings, evoking the feeling of sending someone to sleep with a
            lullaby. It fits well with the backstory of the White Lady herself, since she is the mother of all the
            vessels, and shows more signs of affection for them than the Pale King did. The rhythm or tune of this motif
            is also present in other tracks like the usual Boss Remixes. This melody is actually the Pale King's theme,
            and most of the characters associated with a Recurring Riff of this motif hold a connection to the Pale King
            in one way or another.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Y7JziBUOMA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "White Palace" is a faster version of "The White Lady" with more accompaniment, turning the lullaby-like
            melody of the latter into a grander piece, sounding like the themes played in stories about royalty.
            "Resting Grounds" is a very slow, melancholic version of this melody that emphasizes the sad decline of the
            Pale King's empire, playing as you are surrounded by the graves of its former denizens. It is yet another
            relaxing piano piece similar to "Dirtmouth", but there is also a violin and a faint choir added in the
            background. Thematically, it is the ambience for the In-Universe cemetery of the game. It also contains
            several hidden leitmotifs, with its bassline being the bassline from the main theme, Hollow Knight,
            converted into a 3/4 time signature.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4JWANCA-Pbw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Dung Defender" happens when you take the "White Lady" motif and increase the happy and upbeat factor. No,
            it doesn't sound like the mighty march of knights that "Truth, Beauty and Hatred" gives, but this is more
            similar to the themes of gallant sailors and pirates, something straight out of Pirates of the Caribbean.
            More to the point, it is far and away one of the most upbeat songs in the entire soundtrack, recalling the
            golden age of Hallownest, when the Five Great Knights were heroes, celebrated the kingdom over.
            "White Defender" is an interesting case of a mix of the Dark Reprise and Triumphant Reprise tropes, because
            it combines the upbeat and silly "Dung Defender" theme with the melancholic "White Palace" one. Perhaps the
            inclusion of a choir accompaniment makes it feel "grander". Then it shifts to a sadder and calmer tune
            around 1:32. It is ultimately a Dark Reprise, however, as it represents the Dung Defender's longing for his
            fellow knights and a past long gone.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkgHqBl12Cg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Hornet" mostly uses the violin and other stringed instruments throughout the track, which is a meaningful
            Fridge Brilliance and a wise choice of instruments, since Hornet is a spider and uses a stringed weapon such
            as silk to fight. Near the end, one can hear a beautiful violin rendition of the "White Lady" motif on the
            2:06 timestamp.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xkM8mWC4Kk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Daughter of Hallownest" is the remixed version of the previous song, heard when fighting Hornet in the
            Godhome. This time, the faster violins, the added orchestra, and the choir singing to the tune all make it
            even better. Both tracks are also used extensively in the Background Music for the trailers of Hollow
            Knight: Silksong.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5_nMrARi-k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            The first time this leitmotif is heard in-game is actually right at the beginning, underscoring the "Elegy
            for Hallownest" epigraph, which is addressed to the Pale King.
            "Mantis Lords" has probably the fastest beat out of all the tracks in the game, and it's most likely
            intentional to always keep you focused and in your toes during the entire fight, since the Mantis Lords are
            that fast for being Fragile Speedsters. You gotta have something to keep you alert, and their boss theme
            perfectly does just that.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp5M2BAXwSo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Sisters of Battle" is louder, and has a beautiful choir much like how the other remixes nail it (i.e. "Dung
            Defender" to "White Defender", "Hornet" to "Daughter of Hallownest"). Although the original version is
            already fast, the choir accompaniment still manages to sync in with the even louder and more aggressive
            sounds produced by the violins.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4yxgEsS8ogM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Dirtmouth" is one of the common cases of the Recurring Riff trope in the game, a lonely piano instrumental
            that plays over the initially-lonely town. The ambience is just that fitting for a Knight wanting to simply
            rest on a bench. Its motif is also used in at least three tracks of the game.
            "Greenpath" opens up with a nice plucking of strings, then the Dirtmouth motif gets repeatedly played at a
            faster ratio, alluding to the livelier, yet still-relaxing atmosphere that the Greenpath has. Then the beats
            get faster around the 2:08 mark, climaxing at 2:26.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NSlkW1fFkyo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Decisive Battle" is a pulse-pounding version of this motif, with a heavy emphasis on fast drum beats,
            enough to keep you awake during the tense fight scenes against most bosses where this is played.
            "Crystal Peak" combines a haunting chiming hum overlaid across a thundering but subdued and melancholy bass
            line that is simultaneously meditative, pulse-pounding and also very lonely, as you crawl through the
            mechanised depths and heights of the crystal mines.<br>

            "City of Tears" is memorable for having a relaxing One-Woman Wail persisting throughout all the other male
            choir and instrumentals. The constant tune of the lyre and violins near the end also sets up a dramatic
            ambience without being too gloomy (which fits the mood when you are introduced to the cutscene showing the
            monument to the Hollow Knight). The last few seconds also have the sounds of rain, very fitting since the
            City of Tears is always under constant rain for being built below the Blue Lake.<br>

            "Soul Sanctum" is a very haunting Ominous Pipe Organ remix of the "City of Tears" theme. It's loud enough to
            keep you tense when travelling throughout the sanctum, and the ambience can be imposing as well. Then at the
            2:15 timestamp, you'll hear what would perfectly fit as an introduction to an action-packed movie, while the
            "City of Tears" motif gets a male choir version. Near the end, all of the instruments get louder and faster
            until they all simultaneously halt along with the choir.<br>

            "Soul Master" is another remix of the two tracks above, but take the part where the choir sings in the "Soul
            Sanctum" theme, loop it from there and maintain the pulse-pounding instrumentals all throughout, and you'll
            get this version.<br>

            "Dream" is an ethereal, uncanny version of the "City of Tears" melody that plays whenever the Knight is
            traveling in the dream world.<br>

            "Dreamers" is a more dramatic version of the above track that only plays when you are confronting each of
            the three Dreamers.<br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tFRd79Ukb8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
           
            "Reflection", the theme played in the stag stations and tram ways, can be just as relaxing as the
            "Dirtmouth" theme, but this track also includes a persistent noise in the background to evoke the feeling of
            being safe while in a state of constant travel. There's also a slightly modified version of this that plays
            in the Queen's Gardens - having a more distorted noise and a filter to perfectly evoke that place having a
            gramophone hanging out of nowhere.<br>

            when the percussion and bass are added during the challenge rooms and the Traitor Lord boss battle.
            "Accordion Brumm" is the tune that Brumm plays inside the Grimm Troupe's tent, giving it a French-sounding
            interpretation of a Creepy Circus Music. "Accordion Nymm" is a variation of Brumm's accordion music, but
            instead of sounding like creepy circus music, it is closer to a livelier carnival theme. It also symbolises
            how Nymm is hinted to be an amnesiac Brumm, who forgot the times he spent on that creepy and sinister
            troupe. At this point, Nymm just wanted to liven up the moody town of Dirtmouth.
            "The Grimm Troupe" is quite fitting for the local insect Dracula being a Shout-Out to the Castlevania
            franchise, because his musical theme is reminiscent of the haunting church/orchestral style of Michiru
            Yamane in the Castlevania games. It's mostly played by an Ominous Pipe Organ accompanied with unintelligible
            chanting... until he whips out his Bullet Hell attack, and the orchestra adds a battery and an electric
            bass.

            "Nightmare King" is a symphonic metal remix of "The Grimm Troupe". You can hear the blend of the choir,
            drums and other instruments as early as 37 seconds into the track.
            The theme for the "Hive Knight" is yet another one of those triumphant drum-marching tracks with upbeat
            trumpets. Then at 1:54, the trumpets and drums cycle and alternate before the drums end the song.

            "Gods & Glory" from the Godmaster update has a dramatic feel to it, getting you pumped up as you take on the
            game's bosses one after another. It starts right out with a loud choir that persists throughout the song,
            then the fast drum beats come in after 52 seconds and blend with the choir until the end. There is also
            another shift at the 1:46 timestamp that sounds just as good as the first half. "Haunted Foes" for the
            harder bosses in the Godhome constantly plays out calm and slow, but you can hear the distinct drum beats in
            the background. Everything does get gradually louder near the end, but still maintain the melancholic
            feeling.

            <br>
            "Dream Battle" starts right off the bat as a fast-paced, heart-pounding work, fitting for an action scene
            like the "Soul Master" theme does... but you'll get to appreciate the drum beats and their accompanying
            violins better here during the second half of the song. It also fits as the theme of the Warrior Dreams,
            since they are fast bosses.

            "Kingdom's Edge", although having several instruments being simultaneously played from the start, is one of
            the rare lonely soundtracks in the game as you can hear the sounds of a flute. Then everything seems to
            shift into a very gloomy state near the end. There are parts of the theme that sound somewhat like the works
            of Igor Stravinsky.
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XGcYPyZRyTY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            "Radiance". Ah, the background theme of the True Final Boss; it has constant changes for the entirety of the
            song, from the pitch of the choir, to the choice of instruments used, but still makes nice transitions. Then
            in the final 10 seconds, the instruments gradually become louder, before ending in one final note.
